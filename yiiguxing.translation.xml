      <item value="Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code int} value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of {@code nextInt} is that one {@code int} value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All {@code bound} possible {@code int} values are produced with (approximately) equal probability. The method {@code nextInt(int bound)} is implemented by class {@code Random} as if by: &lt;pre&gt; {@code public int nextInt(int bound) { if (bound &lt;= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;bound must be positive&quot;); if ((bound &amp; -bound) == bound) i.e., bound is a power of 2 return (int)((bound (long)next(31)) &gt;&gt; 31); int bits, val; do { bits = next(31); val = bits % bound; } while (bits - val + (bound-1) &lt; 0); return val; }}&lt;pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hedge &quot;approximately&quot; is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits. If it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits, then the algorithm shown would choose {@code int} values from the stated range with perfect uniformity. &lt;p&gt; The algorithm is slightly tricky. It rejects values that would result in an uneven distribution (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible by n). The probability of a value being rejected depends on n. The worst case is n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 12, and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2. &lt;p&gt; The algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially: it returns the correct number of high-order bits from the underlying pseudo-random number generator. In the absence of special treatment, the correct number of &lt;i&gt;low-order&lt;i&gt; bits would be returned. Linear congruential pseudo-random number generators such as the one implemented by this class are known to have short periods in the sequence of values of their low-order bits. Thus, this special case greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned by successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two. @param bound the upper bound (exclusive). Must be positive. @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code int} value between zero (inclusive) and {@code bound} (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence @throws IllegalArgumentException if bound is not positive @since 1.2" />
