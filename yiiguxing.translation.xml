It defaults to zero (stop immediately). replayExpirationMillis — configures a delay (in milliseconds) between the stopping of the sharing coroutine and the resetting of the replay cache (which makes the cache empty for the shareIn operator and resets the cached value to the original initialValue for the stateIn operator). It defaults to Long.MAX_VALUE (keep replay cache forever, never reset buffer). Use zero value to expire the cache immediately. This function throws IllegalArgumentException when either stopTimeoutMillis or replayExpirationMillis are negative." />
